GNOME Keysign is a tool to make signing OpenPGP keys as easy as possible.
This is the v0.7 release which fixes a few bugs and increases gpg 2.1.

Changes
==========

 * showing a message when you don't have a private key
 * Disable Next or Back button when hitting the end of the notebook
 * More Python 3 compatible code (e.g. HTTP server, StringIOs, dict.items)
 * (Hopefully) more efficient bar code rendering to increase the
   success rate when reading it
 * Using zbar's cache to hopefully save some CPU cycles while scanning
